If it makes you feel ANYbetter, everytime i go to the store (which is often because they keep sending my faulty phones you'd think after phone number 20, im serious, they'd get that i need a fully functioning phone!) the "customer service" is horrible they always blame me for the phones being fault and they give me attitude, until i talk to the manager or the general manager. Ugh! but i feel your pain!
Just keep calling until you get the right VzW Rep. I enjoy my Verizon Wireless service and will not be cancelling any time soon. I have called Verizon CS numerous times and every single time (except for the incident above), they have gave me great customer service. =)
I cannot believe that you have gotten 20 defective phones! ROFL! I think that it's time to admit some responsibility.
I meant to say that their phones are not worth the scrap metal they are made from
 
I have had Verizon for over 10 years. I still remember when the hot new thing was color screens on the phones (woooo) (yeah I got one) I have most likely spent a combined total of a week on the phone (thank god airtime free) with verizon, It is all in the rep. Some are just not that into it. Like the guy at your work that you wonder why he still has his job. but you do sometimes get a person that is just gold. Hint If they sound like they are reading hang up you will save time in the long run
I am so surprised to see these posts.  I've had Verizon service for years and years.  Also had occasion to do business with the "other" big company.  There is absolutely no comparison in the customer service.  I've had lots of occasions to contact Verizon customer service for technical and billing issues.  Have always been happy with the results.  Maybe it is the representative or they have training issues.  I would escalate to management if I had these kinds of problems.
Verizon is THE WORST company I have ever had to deal with on anything.  They accept no responsibility for the information that is provided by another CSR.  They accept no responsibility for charging people for services that have never been used.  They are nothing but money hungry **bleep**.
 wait until you have an issue that you can't get resolved and you go round and round with some **bleep** from customer service.
any rerate over 50% is against policy if it is not a verizon wireless error (which in this case it is not) and cannot be issued.
Even if you escalate to upper management, they won't help you. The woman I just spoke to was nasty.
I want to do something that will LET THE WORLD KNOW!  am I dreaming?  I hope not.
